# U_CAN: Ukraine towards Carbon Neutrality — Interactive Presentation

An interactive, single-page presentation that showcases a data-driven approach to reducing urban traffic emissions using adaptive clustering and AI-driven signal control. Optimized for 1280×720 viewing with keyboard navigation, figure placeholders, and a clean, accessible layout.

## Live Demo

- GitHub Pages (recommended)
  https://radiukpavlo.github.io/my-study-python/blob/main/%5B00%5D_papers/68_curves/urban-traffic-deck/index.html

- Direct Preview (no Pages setup required)

If a link returns 404, give it a minute after pushing changes, then refresh.

## How to Use

- Navigate: Space / Right / Down → next slide; Left / Up → previous slide
- Jump: Home → first slide; End → last slide
- Overview: press “O” to open a slide index overlay for quick jumping
- The slide counter and a clickable progress bar help with pacing and Q&A

## View Locally

- Simply open `index.html` in your browser
- Optional: serve locally for consistent asset loading (any static server works)

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1) In your repository, go to Settings → Pages  
2) Under “Build and deployment,” set Source to “Deploy from a branch”  
3) Select branch: `main`, folder: `/ (root)`, then Save  
4) Wait for deployment to complete (a few minutes), then use the Pages URL above

## Troubleshooting

- Blank page or missing assets: hard-refresh (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R) to clear caches
- 404 on GitHub Pages: confirm Pages is enabled for `main` and the index file is at repo root
- Slow loads: external CDNs may be rate-limited; try again or use the RawGitHack link

## Summary

This deck presents:
- The problem context and motivation
- Method 1: Adaptive Cascade Clustering (HDBSCAN + k-means)
- Method 2: DRL-based traffic signal control
- Experimental setup and realistic scenarios
- Results and roadmap for pilot deployment
